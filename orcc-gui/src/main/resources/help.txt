*** Main menu section ***

Main Menu: File

 File -> open audio
  To create a sound visual animation you need first load an audio file, 
  
 File -> open audio -> from file
  select a file, uncompressed formats .wav and .aiff and MIDI are supported
  via the standard Java audio. The packaged humble video library enables also 
  compressed formats like mp3. Humble is able to open audio and video containers,
  so it is possible to extract the audio from a video file if the formats are
  supported. Note on MIDI: since this is music meta information the actual sound
  depends on your systems MIDI synthesizer.
  If you try to open a file with an unsupported audio format you get an error.
  
 File -> open audio -> [name of built in audio]
  opens a built in audio used for demo and examples
  
 After loading you can play the audio by pressing the play > button, the volume
 level can be adjusted with the volume slider (not supported on some formats)
  
 File -> exit
  exits soundvis, displays a warning if there are unsaved changes.

Main Menu: Session

  Session -> open session
   opens a previously saved session from a file (.xml extension)
   
  Session -> save session as
   opens a dialog to save the session under a different name and/or location  
  
  Session -> open session
   saves the current session if has been saved previously, otherwise it forwards 
   to 'save session as' 
   
  Session -> new
   creates a basic session, if the current session has unsaved changes a warning
   is displayed.
   
  Session -> demos
   opens built in demo sessions to get a quick start
   
  Session -> show changes
   opens a change log with all changes since the last save, can be used for
   selective manual undos
   
Main Menu: Export
   
  Export -> start 
   A file dialog will appear where you can select the directory and the name
   of the exported file. Currently only .mov and .mp4 formats are supported as
   video containers. The properties of the video and audio track are those
   configured in 2.)
   
  Export -> stop
   stops a running export, the already exported video will be incomplete but 
   not corrupted.
  
  Export -> frame as image
   saves the current frame as still image
   
Main Menu: Configuration

  Configuration -> video size
   sets the output size (pixel)
   
  Configuration -> frame rate
   sets the frame rate of the video, depending on the audio input sampling rate
   some frame rates do not divide evenly and are disabled in the setting
   
  It is possible to change video settings on a video work in progress, but some 
  canvas might appear different on different video sizes and frame rates, so 
  settings need to be adapted manually when changing these properties, 
  therefore it is best to decide early on the formats.
  
  Configuration -> audio output 
   The audio of the video can be compressed (mp3) or uncompressed
   
   possible combinations:
   audio input ->  setting  ->  resulting video-audio
  
   LINEAR -> LINEAR -> pcm (pcm_s16be)
   LINEAR -> COMPRESSED -> mp3 (libmp3lame)
   COMPRESSED -> COMPRESSED -> taken from input
   COMPRESSED -> LINEAR -> pcm (pcm_s16be)
   
  Configuration -> preferences (startup)
   
   look and feel:
    Allows to choose from the available look and feels
    
   window maximized on startup:
    if checked soundvis starts maximized, otherwise the last user defined size
    is used
    
   both settings require a restart of soundvis to become effective
  
Main Menu: View

  View -> video zoom
   sets the zoom of the realtime monitoring video, does not affect video output.

  View -> wave zoom
   sets the zoom of the audio wave if 'zoom wave' is selected
   
Main Menu: Info

  Info -> system environment
   shows system settings
   
  Info -> show log
   shows soundvis log file, the buffer size can be increased or reduced, a
   size of 0 switches logging off.
   
Main Menu: Help

  Help -> basics
   shows this help text
   
  Help -> about
   shows information about soundvis

 ----------------------------------------
   
The timeline contains playback controls:

Stop button []
stops playing and resets the position to the video position pointer, next play
will start from there

Play / Pause button > ||
 starts playing video and audio, if canvas with history are used playing video
 will need pre - run and not start immediately.
 Pressing during playback will pause the video and audio.

State display READY, PLAYING, PAUSED, EXPORTING, LOADING
 The READY state allows all editing and configuration changes, this is the only
 state where video size, frame rate can be changed, canvas can be added or 
 removed and the audio input or whole sessions can be loaded. 
 The PLAYING state allows canvas property edit while the video and audio is 
 playing.
 The PAUSED state allows the same as PLAYING plus canvas list to be re-ordered.
 The EXPORTING, LOADING states do not allow any editing.

Volume control
 allows to set the playback audio volume (not enabled on some pro audio formats)

Zoom wave button
 allows to zoom the audio wave for precise audio - video synchronization

Frame and speed display
 shows the current frame number and playback speed, if speed is too low or not 
 steady it will be difficult to edit the video - this is due to the real time 
 nature of the playback - nevertheless the exported video will very likely have 
 no problem since all calculations are done during export.
 
Length display 00:00:00
 shows the length of the loaded audio

Progress bar
 shows progress in % during PLAYING or EXPORTING

Directly on the sound wave timeline is the video position pointer
Each canvas is also displayed according to the layer ordering, an expanded 
canvas is also shown expanded on the timeline showing any effect curves.

 ----------------------------------------

The layers section has all canvas that produce video, the canvas layers are
rendered in order

Layers Menu: canvas

 to add a canvas to the session select a canvas from the menu:
 
 canvas -> add canvas -> <canvas name>
  
  Canvas can only be added or removed if the playback is stopped 
  (showing state READY next to the play button)
  

Basic configuration on each canvas layer:

 Canvas common tool bar:
 
 Change layer order using the move handle
  Depending on the type of canvas it draws more or less opaque, some canvas 
  are for background use others for foreground, to change the layer position:
  drag the canvas row up or down (playback must be READY or PAUSED)
    
 View canvas preview in the preview icon
  shows a simplified preview of the canvas, clicking the icon shows the canvas
  highlighted in the timeline panel and shows its duration and layer position
  
 Change canvas settings using the expand/collapse button
 
  Click on the + button of the canvas to bring up the property editor
  The editor shows all individual settings for that canvas
  This is possible in all playback states, on some canvas the desired
  changes will be obvious only in PLAY state while the audio is playing.
   
  opening the canvas will also show canvas time effects in the time line if
  the canvas has any, each effect group has different colors.
  this can be explored using the demo sessions.

 Enabling / disabling a canvas using the on/off checkbox
  To disable a canvas click the checkbox 'on' or 'off'
  The canvas will keep all settings but will not be part of the animation
      

 Adjust showing length of canvas using frame from and frame to boxes

  Per default the added canvas is showing from start of the audio until the end
  To adjust the showing duration you can either
  
  type the frame number in the 'from' or 'to' box
  or  
  on the 'Audio Timeline' audio wave form adjust the yellow bar to the right 
  position then double click on 'from' or 'to' box of the canvas and the 
  frame number will automatically be copied from the wave selection.
   
  The fit/zoom button will zoom in to the audio so adjustments can be made
  precisely to the wave form
  The resolution of the zoom can be set via the menu View -> wave zoom
  
 Adjust opaqueness using paint transparency
  allows to adjust opaqueness from 0-100 percent
  
 Adjust pixel painting standard or XOR
  switches from standard painting to XOR mode where the pixel depends on the
  color from the layer below.
  XOR works only with paint transparency 100% otherwise this setting is ignored!
 
 Remove canvas with the remove handle
  To delete a canvas click on the X on the right, all settings of the canvas
  will be lost.

 shows depending on state 
 
 READY and PAUSED 
  the current frame as snapshot 
 PLAYING 
  the video is displayed in realtime the speed is ideally 100%
  depending on the canvas animation demand and system graphics capabilities
  playback might get slower and video display might flicker,
  main reasons for playback performance problems are large video size and high
  number of gradients, XOR or history use on the canvas.
 EXPORTING 
  the video is displayed faster or slower than realtime depending on calculation 
  work needed for video and audio conversions.
